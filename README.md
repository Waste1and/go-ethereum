# Roxas Blockchain

## Project Overview
Roxas is a fork of Ethereum designed to offer a more efficient and developer-friendly blockchain environment. Our primary goals are to reduce gas fees through advanced fee mechanisms, introduce new ways to incentivize network development, and enhance developer tools and APIs, making it easier to build and deploy applications on the Roxas blockchain.

## Features

### Lower Gas Fees
- **Dynamic Fee Mechanism**: A real-time dynamic base fee calculation based on network congestion.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Efficient computation techniques to optimize transaction processing.
- **Fee Discounts**: Fee reductions for frequent users and high-volume transactions.

### Developer Incentives
- **Small Developer Fee**: A minimal percentage of every transaction fee is allocated to the network's development fund. This fund is used for expanding and upgrading the blockchain infrastructure.
  - **Fee Allocation Example**:
    - Total Transaction Fee: 0.01 ROXAS
    - Allocation:
      - 95% (0.0095 ROXAS) to validators/miners.
      - 5% (0.0005 ROXAS) to the development fund.
  - **Transparent Tracking**: The developer fund is stored in a public address, and all expenditures are recorded and viewable via the Roxas block explorer.

## New Features and Mechanisms

### Gasless Transactions
- Enable users to interact with the blockchain without paying gas fees directly by using sponsored transactions funded by dApp developers.

### Cross-Chain Compatibility
- Seamless interaction with other blockchains to foster a connected ecosystem.

### Enhanced Security
- Advanced features like zero-knowledge proofs and multi-signature wallets.

### Scalability Improvements
- Introduction of sharding and layer-2 solutions to improve network scalability.

## Developer-Focused Upgrades

### Developer Incentive Model
- **How It Works**:
  - A portion of transaction fees is automatically routed to a dedicated development fund managed via a decentralized governance mechanism.
  - Developers submit proposals for network upgrades, infrastructure scaling, or new features.
  - Token holders vote on proposals, ensuring transparency and community alignment.

- **Implementation Example (Smart Contract Snippet)**:
  ```solidity
  // Smart contract for transaction fee allocation
  contract FeeSplitter {
      address public developerFund;
      address public validatorPool;
      uint public devFeePercentage = 5; // 5% of transaction fee

      constructor(address _developerFund, address _validatorPool) {
          developerFund = _developerFund;
          validatorPool = _validatorPool;
      }

      function distributeFees(uint256 totalFee) external {
          uint256 devFee = (totalFee * devFeePercentage) / 100;
          uint256 validatorFee = totalFee - devFee;

          payable(developerFund).transfer(devFee);
          payable(validatorPool).transfer(validatorFee);
      }
  }
